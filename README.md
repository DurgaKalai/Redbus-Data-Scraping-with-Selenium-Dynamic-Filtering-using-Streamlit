# Redbus-Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
##  Introduction
This project aims to automate the collection of bus travel data from the RedBus website, which provides essential information like bus routes, schedules, pricing, and seat availability. Using Selenium for web scraping, we will gather data across multiple states and store it in an SQL database for efficient management. Additionally, a Streamlit application will be developed to visualize this data, enabling users to explore and analyze trends easily. This initiative seeks to enhance operational efficiency and support informed decision-making in the transportation industry
